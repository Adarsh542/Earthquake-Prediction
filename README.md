# Earthquake-Prediction

Introduction and problem description 

Forecasting earthquakes is a crucial problem in Earth science because of their devastating and large scale consequences. The objective of this project is to when the earthquake will take place. Specifically predict the time remaining before laboratory earthquakes occur from real-time seismic data. Impact of this project​: potential to improve earthquake hazard assessments that could save lives and billions of dollars in infrastructure. Given seismic signals we are asked to predict the time until the onset of laboratory earthquakes​. ​

Pre-processing of data is followed by construction of a stacking
model that combines Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
Algorithms. Algorithms develop this mathematical model reliant on
“training data-set”.
